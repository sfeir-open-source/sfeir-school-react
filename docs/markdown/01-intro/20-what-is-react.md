# What is React?

- **React** manages the **view** of your application

  - the V of MVC ?
  - something completely different ?

Notes:

- a view library: produce a dom tree with javascript
- render it in the browser (or somewhere else)
- calculate the differences, re-render
- render something completely different (native, music ?)

- With **React** you describe the Document (html)

  - e.g. the state of elements at a given time,
  - and you **re-describe** it entirely when it should change

- **React-DOM** will take care of creating
