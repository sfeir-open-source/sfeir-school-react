# Handler events

## SyntheticEvent
* follows W3C specification (same API)
* normalises browser inconsistencies

In React there is no use for imperative APIs such as addEventListener.
Event handlers are declared directly on the JSX tag
=> they are passed like callbacks to a function

Notes:
- show setState with a function
- explain async nature of setState
