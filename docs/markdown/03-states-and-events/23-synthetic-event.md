# Handler events

## SyntheticEvent

- follows W3C specification (same API)
- normalises browser inconsistencies

In React there is no use for imperative APIs such as addEventListener.
Event handlers are declared directly on the JSX tag
=> they are passed like callbacks to a function

Notes:

- show setState with a function
- explain async nature of setState
