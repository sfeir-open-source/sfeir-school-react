# 03-state-and-clicks instructions

## How to run?

```Bash
cd ./steps
npm run 03-state-and-clicks
```

## TODO

1. Edit only the `src/components/Carousel.tsx` component

   - Display the first person in the people list at start

2. Bind the click of the previous/next button

   - When clicking on the previous button, we should display the previous person
   - When clicking on the next button, we should display the next person
   - Cycle through people
