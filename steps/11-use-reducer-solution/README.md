# 11-use-reducer instructions

## How to run?

```Bash
cd ./steps
npm run 11-use-reducer
```

## TODO

1. Rewrite Carousel to use useReduce to handle all Carousel state

   - Edit only `useCarousel` from `src/components/Carousel.tsx`
   - You should not change the API (states and functions) returned by the `useCarousel` hook, only change its implementation
